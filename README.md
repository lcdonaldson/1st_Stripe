# 1st_Stripe

I just found out about this cool way to process credit cards withought having to get all the crazy certifications. I guess I should clarify that I think it is very wise to build up to those certifications and skillsets in security measures. I just think this is a great way to practice seeing the real thing. Using Stripe.JS I dont store the user data, but instead use tokens that area used in their place. I will comment more as I find out more but this was something I wanted to just get started and experiment with.
